MediCRM: AI-Powered EHR Analytics Platform
Overview
MediCRM is a next-generation, AI-integrated Electronic Health Record (EHR) analytics platform built to support small and mid-sized healthcare providers. Focused on leveraging FHIR standards, MediCRM empowers clinics, practices, and medical administrators with real-time insights without the need for data analysts.

By combining OpenAI’s GPT-based natural language processing with structured EHR data from FHIR-compatible databases, the platform allows medical professionals to ask plain-English questions like:

“Which patients are at risk for readmission in the next 30 days?”

“Which doctor has the highest number of hypertensive patients?”

“What medications are most frequently prescribed in the cardiology department?”

MediCRM converts these natural-language queries into optimized SQL, fetches data from PostgreSQL, and delivers clear, conversational answers—within seconds.

This platform is designed to improve operational efficiency, reduce administrative overhead, and help healthcare teams make faster, smarter, and more data-driven decisions—all through a clean, user-friendly interface powered by modern cloud-native microservices and FHIR integration.
